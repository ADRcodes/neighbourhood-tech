Bio: From the moment Devin Cuddy was drawn to playing music, he was determined to get as close as possible to the sources of all the sounds he loved, whether they were made by rock and roll’s founding fathers, the Grand Ole Opry’s honky tonk heroes, or Jelly Roll Morton and the kings of jazz. Devin developed a blend of these sounds, that is uniquely his own, on a weekly basis at Toronto’s Cameron House, which he still considers his home base. These days this Juno-Nominated artist takes his sound from Coast to Coast to Coast.",

Join Joan Dohey of Time to Heal, Nadine Emberley of Reiki on the Rock, and Tina Pomroy of Going Om as they guide you through an evening of release, connection, and inner peace. Your journey will begin with Soma breath guided by Nadine to activate your calming, parasympathetic nervous system and begin to release what is no longer serving and connect to your deeper Self. With an awareness of your inner world, your journey will continue with cultivating embodiment through somatic movement and dance. A curated playlist and Tina’s healing voice will guide you as you explore and release body tensions and emotional patterns and connect to layers beneath the physical surface. Your evening will end with Joan’s soothing crystal bowl and muscial sound bath as your body, mind, and spirit melt into a blissful, soothing space, while Tina and Nadine offer Reiki love and optional soothing touch to each of you.",

Alongside these macro issues is a window on the daily trials of a technologically compromised ADHD addled adult, who came of age in a day when a ‘hash tag’ was something you got after getting too close to the hash knives! Whether getting comedic mileage with classic bits on generational differences in families then and now; teacher terrors of public-school days; hand me-down hockey gear; party hearty camping trips with pals in those ‘bullet proof days of yore’, there’s something for everybody. ‘Ultimately though, ‘The Noise Between Our Ears’ sees Ron as the ever struggling ‘Everyman’, doing his best to make sense of a world off kilter while bedeviled by forces beyond his control, where airlines constantly lose luggage, stock portfolios nosedive, mortality’s the new reality and the barber spends more time trimming your ears than he does your head!",
